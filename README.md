# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project 
- This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to deliver your results. You will submit the following:
- Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
- Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
- Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results (README.md)

### Purpose
- Use kickstarter data to deliver data driven analysis report by providing easy to read graphs and charts as well as raw data spread sheet for validation of work. 
- Charts will help end user make better decision on when to launch their campiang and how much to set there goals to get the best results
## Analysis and Challenges
- Creating the COUNTIFS() functions was the most challenging part of the exercise 
- Watched the hints video 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](C:\Users\soren\OneDrive\Desktop\Module 1\Resources\Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
- based on our analysis, the best month to launch your kickstarter is May 
- based on our analysis, the worst month to launch your kickstarter is December 
- 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](C:\Users\soren\OneDrive\Desktop\Module 1\Resources\Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
- based on our analysis, kickstarters that had a goal of between 40,000 and 49,999 were funded 100% of the time.  Although this data maybe a little misleading with only 4 kickstarters being funded.  Kickstarters with a goal between 15,000 and 25,000 had a success rate of 94% with over 93 projects being successful.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- based on our analysis, the best month to launch your kickstarter is May 
- based on our analysis, the worst month to launch your kickstarter is December 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- based on our analysis, kickstarters that had a goal of between 40,000 and 49,999 were funded 100% of the time.  Although this data maybe a little misleading with only 4 kickstarters being funded.  Kickstarters with a goal between 15,000 and 25,000 had a success rate of 94% with over 93 projects being successful
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- some limitaions in the data were that we only were looking at kickstarter that dealt with theater and specific to what Loise had interest in and not the entire populous data of all projects with parent and subcategories 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- number of backer vs. total pledged amount 
- percentange of goal meet vs. number of backers
